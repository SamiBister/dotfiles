# Use brew to install software when possible

## Status

Approved

## Context

I want to have fewest possible places to update software. I want to be able to
update software with one command. Brew is the best way to do that on macOS.

## Decision

I will install softare with brew when possible.

I will use ansible-galaxy role that is supported by community actively, so that
possible problems will be fixed quickly.

## Consequences

The script will use brew to install software when possible.
